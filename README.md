# sails-angular-playground

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) and a [AngularJS](http://sailsjs.org) playground. 

Things to note:
- No client side rendering. The entire Angular app lives in /assets, so it's portable and can easily be packaged for deployment by running "sails www" from the root.
- JWT Token authentication / authorization over http and socket.io.
